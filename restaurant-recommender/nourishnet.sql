We were moved to a location closer to their inside section, far away from the garden and it didn\'t even have a view of the garden. The people who had apparently \'reserved\' our original table were a group of 5 people (including children who were running around in the garden). Clearly they had some kind of connection to the Manager and he had showed preference to them over us. I was appalled as in the past I\'ve had pretty good experiences at this restaurant. The food is good (not incredible but pretty standard every time) and usually the service is on point.

However, I am disappointed to report that there has been a significant decline in both in quality since the management change. \n\nDuring my latest visit, I experienced a terrible issue: I ordered feta cheese, which was clearly expired. Instead of addressing the concern professionally, the manager argued with me and invalidated my experience, claiming to be an expert on cheese. This was not only dismissive but also unprofessional. We are experienced with cheese, even hosting cheese tasting events, so his dismissive attitude was unacceptable. If there was a change in supplier or quality, a simple explanation would have sufficed, but instead, I was met with arrogance and disrespect.\n\nThis incident, and the overall decline in food quality is gone significantly down, suggests that something is not right within the Imara unit. The management\'s attitude particularly a manager arguing over a straightforward issue raises concerns about the standards and customer care at this location. I am losing confidence in the new management and the direction the restaurant is heading.\n\nOverall, the standards have gone downhill, and the service recovery has been lacking. Something is clearly not working, and I hope the management takes this feedback seriously to restore the quality and experience we once enjoyed.

We ordered for usual coffee which was done well and honestly that was the only good thing we liked. For starter we had their prawns in cheese served with garlic bread. The prawns were so tiny and really bland and just immersed in heavy cheese sauce. We did their burger 2 in 1 for 1k as recommended by Josephat. My partner wanted hers medium rare but Josephat advised her to do medium well cause he thought she doesnt know what medium rare is😂😂😂😂😂. Out of respect to him and not to burst his bubble we asked for medium. The burger came well done, fries soggy and the supposed onion rings bland and not palatable.The beef patte was very cold. Honestly the meal really looked horrible and ruined entire experience. \nJosephat was quick enough to apologise and was professional enough to want to do service recovery. We wanted to meet the manager and share feedback and since she was sitting with her assistant she was kind enough not to talk to us and all of a sudden became busy to go bring our check. \nFew things to note: \n1. This is the third spur have attended and seems all of them dont understand doneness of meat\n2. Customer care is wanting and so is attention to details \n3. Its easier to be stereotyped when wanting a certain doneness of meat. I guess africans we dont take meat medium rare or rare....\n4.

We were warmly recommended to try their herbal infusions and special dawas by the head barista, Kennedy Owino, and I must say, it was an enchanting journey from the first sip.\n\nAs someone who doesn’t typically gravitate toward tea or coffee, I didn’t expect to be so thoroughly captivated. Yet, I left Café Amka a true convert.\n\nWe began our tasting with the Relaxing Orange Rooibos, which was simply divine. Next up was the Nairobi Nector—a vibrant infusion of yerba mate, lemongrass, pineapple, hibiscus, and mint. The flavors still dance on my palate as I write this, even a day later.\n\nThen came Brain Power, which completely blew me away. Each element of the infusion hit different parts of my palate in perfect harmony, without any one flavor overpowering the others.\n\nOur final infusion was the Queen Koi, and oh, what a finale it was! With its blend of yerba mate, coconut, ginger, pineapple, chamomile, mint, and lemongrass, we were left in awe, unable to decide which tea was the best—they were all exceptional.\n\nWhile we savored these remarkable teas, we also learned so much about the history of Café Amka. It’s far from your ordinary cafe. Every ingredient is carefully selected, with the barista team curating the menu themselves. Herbs like yerba mate are sourced from indigenous communities in Argentina, and their cacao is exclusively ceremonial-grade and single-origin. Speaking of cacao, we sampled the Nutmeg Cacao—rich, creamy, and utterly luxurious, yet light on the tongue. It was perfection in a cup.\n\nThis cafe completely exceeded our expectations. What started as a brief meet-up with friends turned into two hours of savoring every sip and soaking in the experience.\n\nI cannot recommend this tea experience enough—it should be on everyone’s bucket list when visiting Nairobi’s CBD. I’m already looking forward to my next visit, where I’ll be sure to indulge in their pastries and, of course, more of their exceptional teas! A huge thank you to Kennedy and the entire team—we’ll be talking about this experience for a very long time.\n\nP.S. They also serve amazing coffee, and they’ve won awards for it too.

I had to do it at Ezo!', 'My Booking Experience \n\nMy journey begins with making a reservation at the esteemed Ezo Restaurant. After perusing the menu, social media and reviews, I made an online reservation on 21st October 2024, booking a table for four persons. The time of arrival was supposed to be at 7pm. Which after making the reservation, a message popped-up that the manager will reach out to confirm the reservation.  I did not receive a call or message from the manager at the time of the booking that notwithstanding, my partner was able to follow-up the next day and I received my confirmation via text. \n\nOn Arrival\n\nThe evening ambience is quite good I was very casual in dressing, but I quickly leant my dress code was a little out of place. I should have worn formal or smart casual. In short, the place is too nice for a college jacket, Nike, Chinos and a Polo shirt. Our waiter Immaculate led my partner and I to our table. The initial table met my standards. The waiter was able to do a coat check for my partner and I. We were immediately provided with our menu and an immaculate pieces of chop sticks signaling that we will definitely be treated in an elegant fashion. After a quick glance of the room and placing our drink orders, my partner requested for a change of table/sitting. My partner preferred to have a table with the least distractions. We were pleasantly led to a different table which was even better than the former. \n\nThe Drinks & Starters.\n\nI will focus on my order. I really liked the prices and the list of drinks for the picking. Being a consumer of finer things and with a well-informed pallet, I avoided liquor for the reason I was meeting my partners parents, and I had a long day at work so drinking was not the best idea. So, I opted for an Earl Grey. Its tea I drank so often while in Europe. It is black tea served with bergamot oil and honey. \n\nFor my starter, I had Miso soup, tofu, wakame, enoki mushrooms.  This is the best soup in my opinion I have had the whole year. I might just go back and have this alone and by myself. \n\nMains.\n\nI had made the wrong choice. Let me explain! Red Snapper Katsu with Passion Fruit-Dashi Sauce, Asparagus and Green Beans with a side of baked potatoes. This is going to be alittle disappointing. \n\nPassion Fruit does not pair well with Dashi Sauce and the perfectly cooked Red Snapper! There was something awful about that pairing. I could barely finish my sauce. I tried taking the sauce alone, I paired it with the fish, with the green beans and it was just not working. \n\nI would have ordinarily sent the plate back but, I really liked the Snapper, and I did not want it to go back. Secondly, I like my green beans with a little more seasoned. \n\nAs for the baked potatoes.. I will give it a 5/10. Nothing special about it. \n\nBy this time, I was literally full to the brim. I had no room for desert at this point. But what I can say is that, I think their menu is very interesting. I will be visiting this place at least once a month.', 4, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-09 12:44:29', 'positive', '[\"food\", \"service\", \"atmosphere\", \"location_access\", \"menu_variety\", \"events_entertainment\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

As I stepped out of the lift I was greeted by Emily the hostess and escorted to a table so that see could organize the payment. Great polite friendly service. A gentleman then arrived , ignored me and was more focused on communicating with my girlfriend. 3 times I said to excuse me it think you should be speaking to me I made the booking and am the one paying. Finally when he turned around he asked me what is my problem. I asked him for his name he refused . I explained to him his behavior was most rude. I asked him a few more times for his name before I left he refused. On leaving Emily was most apologetic and apologized on his behalf. I told her she had done nothing wrong. That afternoon I did some research and found the name of the rude gentleman it is Mr Hillary  Okello ( Food & Beverage Manger ) .

As it is 2 mins drive, we were here again today , different team but same type of service. Manager walks in with hands in the pockets!! We ordered pain perdu from teh menu and for a French patisserie/bistro it is a real disaster. The brioche bread has only been passed so briefly into the egg mixuture rather than soaking in it and the panfried.

It’s housed in a spacious, uncluttered hall with huge windows overlooking a terrace (where there are some tables as well). Inside, as you enter, the display counters on the right are filled with glorious-looking croissants, puffs, cake slices, macarons, éclairs, tarts and more. But this isn’t all that the café offers: they also do a range of breakfast dishes, soups, salads, sandwiches, quiches, desserts, teas, coffees and non-caffeinated beverages.\n\nWhile my husband and I examined the menu (conveniently on place mats), our daughter was given her own place mat—a children’s one, which came with puzzles, images to be coloured, and so on. It kept her well occupied while we chose our order. This is what we ate, and my impression of each of the dishes:\n\nSalade de poulet a l’orange: Pieces of cooked chicken, mixed greens, shaved fennel, orange  segments and pine nuts, tossed with a honey mustard dressing that also had grated orange zest in it. A huge bowlful, and delicious. \n\nMini ficelle bacon et oignons: Shaped rather like a large elliptical roll, this was a bread stuffed with plenty of bacon and caramelized red onions. The proportion of bread to filling was perfect, and the large helping of mixed greens with vinaigrette that accompanied it was a great foil for the carbs, meat and fat of the ficelle.\n\nToast a l’avocat: Smashed avocado on toast, amped up. The toast was a beautifully crisp length cut from a long loaf, covered with a very generous quantity of smashed avocado, and topped with a fried egg, sunny side up. On the side was a large helping of mixed leaves, very lightly dressed. Delicious. \n\nSalted caramel tart: About three inches across, the pastry very light and short, and the caramel a very good balance between sweet, bitter and salty. \n\nLemon tart: Excellent, the lemon curd was really lemony and lovely. \n\nWe loved our meal here so much that we bought two things to take away:\n\nAlmond croissant, buttery and flaky and with a luscious filling of frangipane. Not too much, not too little, not too sweet. \n\nPassionfruit macaron: Lovely: the filling had a fabulous flavour of fresh passionfruit, and the macaron was light and mildly chewy. \n\nThe food was superb, and given that we paid just KSH 5120 (which also included two lemonades), good value for money. Service was overall good, but there was some delay in billing, since their billing machine wasn’t working, and it took our waitress a long time to calculate and make out a bill by hand. In the process, our takeaway order got a bit mixed up: we’d ordered a lemon macaron, but discovered we’d been given a passionfruit one only once we got back home. \n\nStill, definitely worth a visit.', 5, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-09 12:44:29', 'positive', '[\"food\", \"drinks\", \"atmosphere\", \"location_access\", \"menu_variety\", \"portion_size\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

When we arrived, our table was ready perfectly located overlooking the play area.Our waiter Peter was very welcoming and experienced, he recommended the best vegetarian Lebanese appetizers that came with plenty of pita bread and various dips: Hommos, Baba ghannouj, Falafel, Fattouche Tabbouleh and divine spinach and cheese pastries,pickles garlic and chili.... For the kids, he recommended pizzas and grilled deboned chicken with rice, which the kids loved. Some of us ordered a few sushi rolls which were perfect: the fish freshness, the perfectly sized roll bites, the stickiness of the rice, the generous pickled ginger portions. I highly recommend one of their signature dishes which is the sashimi salmon salad, its delicious. Wine was flowing, kids were playing in the play area, the live music was lovely. The patrons were there and they came to say hello and check if everything was ok, lovely touch. We had a great afternoon at the Phoenician in Westlands, great food, lovely atmosphere on sundays, but what did it for me was the super attentive and PROMPT service  (im the frustrated one at restaurants always asking for water cutlery napkins).

Another staff member, who smelled of alcohol, eventually brought the bill including charges for the “complimentary” coffee. Despite our protests, and because I had left my card on file, I was charged in full for food that was inedible and coffee that had been offered as complimentary\n\nSince returning abroad, I have emailed both the hotel and headquarters multiple times, sharing receipts, but no one has responded.

I requested the waiter to take back my glass of inferieur house wine so I could enjoy the good wine. He refused, saying it has already been handed out etc, and that it would be a loss to Haru. I told him I understand and I know that but I am a very good customer and come here once a week and spend a lot of money. I told him \'consider it as a complimentary to a good customer and do with it what you want\'. He kept on arguing and arguing. Of course we ordered a more expensive bottle and I left the cheap house wine of 700 ksh untouched.\nWe had fun sitting and drinking and then that same waiter came asking if he could give us the bill since his shift was ending... however to us it seemed like we were being chased away, evidently his objective was to get his tip .

Bearing in mind a number of elements were very easy and quick like noodles, fried rice etc it should not have taken anything like this to deliver this to the table. Eventually, after over two hours, Brian, who introduced himself as the manager, arrived at our table. When asked if he knew the order he said he didn\'t know what we were waiting on but that it would come soon. We\'d been told this repeatedly each time we\'d asked. Brian offered ice creams for the kids \'as compensation\' before the food had even arrived. Bearing in mind we spent 23,300 Kenyan shillings I\'d have thought they could do better. To add to the already poor experience unfortunately, Faith who had served us appeared to find the whole thing funny and laughed about it in front of us at the table.

Almost every one mentioned the food was cold. Especially the fries. The waiter was friendly and attentive and did a good job but unfortunately the kitchen and the chef let him down.

When I got back to the car I saw straight away that my door lock had been jammed open with a screw driver and the CC TV camera inside the compound was also conveniently aimed up at the sky.\nI reported this to the management but there was little sympathy.  I was told not to park outside the compound (where you have to park as there is never parking inside).\nI personally feel that the staff in the compound were a part of this as it happened right in front of them in broad day light.\nIt would be wonderful if  Haru could do something about this and I can have my equipment returned.\nI gather that this is a regular occurrence and cars often have spare wheels taken too....\nAs I said before the food and service in great, but I would suggest taking your own security to ensure that your belongings are not stolen.', 1, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-09 12:44:29', 'negative', '[\"food\", \"service\", \"price_value\", \"location_access\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

Items on your menu were marked with a vegetarian \"V\" symbol, which led us to believe they were safe for consumption by vegetarians and those with dietary restrictions. However, we later learned that these items were fried in the same oil used for cooking fish and beef.\n\nMy son and I have allergies and were negatively affected by this cross-contamination. Moreover, our entire family is strictly vegetarian for personal and ethical reasons. Using the same oil for meat and vegetarian items defeats the purpose of labeling anything \"vegetarian\" and is deeply misleading — not to mention potentially dangerous for people with allergies or dietary restrictions.\n\nI urge you to revisit your food preparation practices and menu labeling. The “V” symbol should universally imply that a dish is truly vegetarian, including being free from cross-contact with meat products.\n\nThis experience has shaken our trust, and we hope no one else has to go through a similar situation.', 1, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-09 12:44:29', 'negative', '[\"food\", \"menu_variety\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

Our waiter, Ivan, while a lovely person, was thoroughly unfamiliar with the menu. We had to ask multiple time and in different ways what things meant (example, \"what does Thai style tempura mean? ...it is the style it is prepared. Uh, yes, but what is that style/ how is it prepared?\" the response were blank eyes. When asked about putting a chili sauce on the side, he assured us they would - and when the dish came it was covered, covered, in chili sauce - and for the one of our party who ordered it - inedible.\n\nWe finally got a different waitstaff, MaryAnne, who was much more switched on - unfortunately, her good service couldn\'t make up for the food. We ordered udon noodles w/ chicken and got rice noodles with chicken (apparently there were no udon noodles, but no one told us that, and BTW, the primary order was for udon noodles (with which a guest could add chicken or prawns, or whatever).  The misnamed Udon noodles with chicken dish was indistinguishable from the Pad Thai with chicken.  The satay was good and we could recommend that. We ordered chicken wings, which came as deep-fried chicken mince (ground chicken) stuffed into a wing and breaded and deep-fried - interesting, but tasting like fried breading mostly. The dessert, the sticky toffee pudding, tasted rather bland, almost overdone.  Another disappointment. \n\nAt the end of the dinner, we waited for a long time for our check, understandable we saw it was busy, but we also waited and waited and waited for the left-overs in the take-away containers, too.\n\nThe food is fair, but it is not particularly thai, and the initial service was appallingly poor.  I might take a business lunch there and order the satay, but we left the restaurant feeling very let down by the whole experience.', 2, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-09 12:44:29', 'negative', '[\"food\", \"service\", \"menu_variety\"]'),

Then dumplings are soggy bad flavor. The seafood salad was spicy, so hold back the bad taste of seafood. The chicken was bland and wrong. The salmon wasn\'t seasoned. The only thing good was the plain rice for dessert. We got fortune cookies. Which was a good touch, and it wasn\'t bad.

Det starter med vi kommer ind og får sat os til rette. Vi glædet os til maden da vi normalt ikke har dårlige oplevelser hos Blue Room. Vi har en tjener som talte meget og bad ham om at tage det roligt da vi havde været her før. Så kommer der en anden og spørg om alt er ok mens jeg tager en bid mad og må der sige i er meget over os og får ikke fred til at nyde min mad og stund med min søn. I må simpelthen give os plads! Og stoppe med alle de henvendelser på ubekvemme tidspunktet midt i maden. Hvis der blev noget skulle jeg nok række ud efter hjælp. Vi bestilte som anvist på billedet en ret med Hummus & Brød, Grillet Kylling Burger x 2. Hvor min søn fik med ekstra æg i stegt helt og jeg et æg med sunny side up. Til der var der coleslaw som var overdynget med peber! Vi bad om nye uden som efterfølgende kom med et ton af mayonnaise hvor min søn godt kunne spise sin var min uspiselig! Bestilte min med pompfritter der har masala dog bad jeg om light da tjener spurgte om jeg ønskede light, medium, hot pompfritter masala?  og fik meget masala så de var uspiselige også. Det der var godt var humus & brød. Vi drak oreo Shake og jeg espresso Shake hvor jeg bad om flødeskum på toppen. Jeg elsker deres kylling/nudler LETO BOWL som jeg har bestilt før på GLOVO app og bestilte 1 til take-away. Vi der fra cirka 16-17p.m kenyansk tid og glemmer endda maden til hjem! Så kl. cirka 21 skynder vi os tilbage efter en fodboldkamp og henter maden med smil på alles læber men… Klokken 23:00p.m starter helvedet! Vi bor på hotel og min søn starter med før sengetid at beklage sig over ekstrem kvalme. Han får lagt sig til at sove hvor jeg er vågen 1 time mere og observere hans velbefindende. Pludseligt vågner han bragt og løber mod toilettet hvor han kastede op voldsomt helt gulvet, døren til toilettet, sengen dertil!!! Jeg får det også dårligt før sengetid skal det siges med kvalme og mavekramper og tod Panodil. 5 minutter efter er det min tur. Dog var min tir værst!!! Jeg kastede op 2 gange som min søn den nat voldsomt og havde diarré resten af de næste 24-timer! Vi endte begge på MEWA hospital med recepter sol bevis for akut madforgiftning. Jeg var i så chok jeg næsten anmeldte det til Kenyas sundheds ministerie. Dog ringede jeg først til den restaurant det omhandlede og talte med deres manager. Hun sagde hun ville ringe tilbage om kort tid så afventede hendes  opkald. Det hun sagde skuffede mig dybt. De nægtede at godtgøre for madforgiftningen ved at returnere mine 2.500ksh. Og sagde alle andre gæster de havde spurgt der spiste der I går var ikke syge!!! Spurgte om de alle havde spist det samme som os??? Så sagde hun de var i gang med at komme til bunds i fødevarekontrollen dog ringede hun aldrig tilbage. De sagde de ville give os noget småt såsom dessert på husets regning ved tilbagevenden men, det er jo ingenting i forhold til min regning, hospitals regning, oplevelse, frygt!!!!

Der ligger THE SPICY GRILL by MNKafé. Vi har som familie allesammen altid forbipasseret og i går tænkte vi “nej, skal vi ikke prøve deres cuisine i dag?” Så vi tog en tur dertil kun for at opleve frygtelig service for første gangs gæster som os. I går var det kun mig og min teenage-søn som tog dertil. Et godt bud var at vi prøver deres mad, service og mærker stemningen efter før vi anbefaler resten af familien m.fl. at tage dertil. Vi kom ind og blev mødt af en tjener, der sagde vi kunne sidde hvor vi ville. Han anbefalede et sted men, vi rykkede et mere eller mindre bedre sted hvor vi havde havudsigt da denne MNKafé ligger ud til havet. Ikke så pænt til den ene side grundet en gammel grund med faldefærdig swimmingpool ellers flot udsigt med frisk havluft. Vi fik en blok til at udfylde selv vores ordre fra menu kortet. Priserne var mellem til dyrt. Der var ej heller ikke mange gæster på dette tidspunkt så det var et rart tidspunkt at være der på. Vi ville gerne have sen frokost så vi tænkte HOTDOGS. Min søn valgte en classic hotdog og jeg valgte en hotdog der havde lidt af det hele inklusiv jalapeño’s. Jeg ville også gerne have en fully loaded fritters. Min søn original salted fries. Vi fik en lille gadget man selv skulle kalde på tjenerne på så det gjorde vi. Da hun kom til bordet havde jeg skrevet (grundet sensitivitet overfor al chili lignende)! At der tages jalapeño’s fra og puttes champignoner oven på i stedet som på deres ene hotdog (som jeg ikke valgte da den var kedelig for mig). Hun sagde at jeg nok ville blive opkrævet ekstra for dette og var uforstående da det ikke var en ekstra topping med udskiftning for en anden topping? Så sagde det ville være skuffende og sagde hun kunne bare tjekke med hendes manager. Hun returnere for desværre sige de vil opkræve mig ekstra. Så takkede skuffende nej til at forblive i restauranten og forlod den øjeblikkeligt. Det vil sige denne restaurant service minded niveau er meget meget lavt. De tager ikke højde for allergier/cøliaki/overfølsomhed i forhold til dine ordre. De går ikke op i din helhedsoplevelse af dit besøg. De virkede komplet ligeglade med deres ansigtsudtryk. De undskyldte ikke for at det gik udover en glad dreng og 5 måneder gravid kvinde som bare prøvede at være lidt påpasselige med en enkelt ingrediens. Det ikke et sted jeg vil anbefale man tager hen da en lille ting kan koste dig da de ikke skaber forståelse for dig som betalende gæst.

I went to Robertos for dinner yesterday evening 17/5/22 after having had lunch there some time ago. I was with family who were reluctant to go to an italian restaurant but I assured them the food was excellent. So two of us ordered different prawn dishes which were on the menu. Mine were pili pili prawns. These came as a poor amateur cooks version of prawn curry. I was served this with fries!. Very disappointed I requested the very excellent waiter to bring me some bread to eat with the watery curry. He obliged very pleasantly. for that I am thankful. My partner ordered another prawn dish which also came as a watery curry, this time with a sweetish taste. He did not bother to eat it and just ate the Fried potatoes which accompanied the prawns. Mind you he had requested for roast potatoes and he does know the difference between roast and fried potatoes. We had also ordered a Pizza which was ok not brilliant as well as ossobucco which again came as a curry with mixed vegetables! All in all very very disappointing . I think the chef was in a CURRY mood.

Average at best.', 'We were taken to Rozina\'s by relatives whilst staying in Mombasa who assured us that it was a very good restaurant. My hopes were high even though everything was pretty unassuming - a very low-key exterior with simple tables inside and a laminated double sided menu to show what was on offer with the list of dishes being extensive! Still, the staff were very welcoming and I was open to be surprised by the standard of fare chosen. Unfortunately it was not exceptional in any way, being very average on the whole.\n\nThe three ladies in our party ordered a large mixed grill to share together with fish fingers which are more like fish kebabs. I ordered the Malaysian chicken whilst the other male in our group had the chicken with garlic sauce. The dishes did not take long at all to appear - never a good sign in my experience - and so we all tucked in. \n\nThe two chicken dishes were remarkably similar in appearance, small pieces of chopped up meat in a heavy sauce. My Malaysian chicken was like nothing that I had eaten in Malaysia earlier in the year with a flavour that was very hard to describe - not unpleasant just unidentifiable! The consistency was also very thick and stodgy, usually a sign of too much thickener being used. The texture of the chicken pieces suggested that they were precooked. The garlic sauce chicken was evidently OK but was also very thick. The mixed grill produced mixed results with the kebabs quite reasonable but the small lamb chop pieces being very overcooked, tough and dry. The fish fingers were surprisingly decent considering the standard of the rest of the food. \n\nOverall decidedly average. Perhaps other items from the menu might produce better tasting dishes but I certainly won\'t be pressing our relatives for a return here!', 3, 'Mombasa', '2025-11-09 12:44:29', 'positive', '[\"food\", \"service\", \"price_value\", \"atmosphere\", \"location_access\", \"menu_variety\", \"portion_size\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

Furthermore, our waiter, David, provided excellent service throughout our afternoon visit.\n\nHowever, beyond David’s attentiveness and the venue’s aesthetics, the overall experience was a series of significant letdowns. To start, I had to follow up with the front desk multiple times just to secure a reservation. I was eventually informed that a prepayment of 5,000 per guest was required, as they do not accept walk-ins. I complied and specifically requested that a particular table be reserved, as I was hosting a birthday lunch. Yet, when my guests arrived, there was no reserved table, and they were told it was free seating.\n\nThe food, unfortunately, was remarkably bland—every guest at our table immediately requested salt and pepper upon its arrival.\n\nThe most egregious issue, however, was the mishandling of my birthday celebration. As is customary in many restaurants, the live band sang \"Happy Birthday\" to guests at two other tables. Despite my friends’ repeated requests, our table was completely ignored—even though we were seated directly in front of the band (the closest table to the band). This blatant oversight wasn’t just rude—it was deeply embarrassing.\n\nWhen we brought this to the manager’s attention, we were met with a frustrating and disjointed series of excuses. First, he claimed the band must have simply forgotten. Then he said our request came too late because the band was already packing up—despite our request being made before the second birthday celebration. He then attempted to distance the restaurant from the situation by claiming the band wasn’t part of their staff. Finally, he cited a supposed hotel “policy” against birthday celebrations—a claim clearly contradicted by the earlier performances for other guests.\n\nWe confronted the manager, who—rather than offering a sincere apology or addressing the issue with his team—chose to deflect responsibility at every turn. It was only after we asked for the final bill and mentioned we’d be leaving an honest review that he rushed to the kitchen. Shortly afterward, the staff returned singing \"Happy Birthday\" and presented a compensatory slice of cake. Surprisingly, they also brought out a hotel-branded birthday photo booth frame—despite their earlier insistence on a “no birthday celebration” policy.\n\nWe chose to be polite to the staff, most of whom had not witnessed the earlier mistreatment. However, we still insisted on paying the bill, declined the belated gesture, and left them to enjoy their slice of cake. \n\nPerhaps they have a certain profile of guests they prefer to host.', 1, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-10 19:07:19', 'negative', '[\"food\", \"service\", \"price_value\", \"atmosphere\", \"location_access\", \"menu_variety\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

It\'s cheap for a \"muzungu\" (non African) and a nice treat for Kenyans who have a bit more money than your average local ie you wouldn\'t see locals who don\'t have good paying jobs in here, it would be too expensive. \n\nThe menu is a mix of Kenyan, Indian and Western food. An average selection of burgers, sandwiches, chicken, curries, hot chips, desserts are also available. But bear in mind, hot chips (or fries) in Africa just don\'t taste the same as in Western countries, and neither does the tomato sauce which is a weird looking fake red colour). The problem with the chips is the oil that they are cooked in probably hasn\'t been changed (fully) likely never, ok at a push maybe last year. To a westerner raised in Australia, New Zealand and the US, these chips just wouldn\'t rate at all. Most of us would chuck it out but can\'t because we\'re in Africa! But the chips aren\'t inedible. If you\'re really hungry and don\'t mind them being beyond greasy and not so flash looking, these are fine. But whatever you do, don\'t grumble about their hot chips or food, Africans love them, and there\'s plenty of hungry kids and adults alike outside on the pavement who may never had a chip in their life. \n\nBut I digress. Gilani\'s is situated above a supermarket by the same name. It is opposite to an entrance to one of the town\'s central clothing markets (ie it\'s not the only one). At the entrance to the building on the street level, you will be checked by a security guard waving an detector paddle over your body, and/or checking your bag/s - as is the case all over Kenya. Note: if you haven\'t noticed this already only female guards are permitted to check female visitors/patrons. It is a matter of decency. \n\nThere are some stairs to climb, and it will be a problem only if you\'re truly unfit. Once at the top, the open cafe/restaurant area looks like one of those lunch places from the 60s and 70s. It has lots of plastic covered tables and plastic chairs,with plastic covered menus. Not flash, but not horrible. The main thing is that it is clean and doesn\'t smell bad or anything like that. To the left is the entrance into the bar area and another entrance into the private dining area. I\'ve eaten in both the open dining area and the private area, whatever takes my fancy at the time. If I\'m feeling a bit grumpy I\'ll head into the private space. And when I say private, I mean that it\'s got cloths on the tables, the chairs are more comfy and I think the floor is carpeted, and you\'re not surrounded by lots and lots of people. In the open dining area, there isn\'t any carpet, and it\'s more of a casual affair. \n\nThe wait staff are always pleasant, much more pleasant than some of the other establishments I\'ve been to. They don\'t really lounge around which I always like, and seem to have a better sense of urgency than other places. Having said that - the food can at times take forever. This happens quite a lot. So if you have children with you and the food is running late, insist they bring out hot chips for the children quickly and make it clear it isn\'t an option. But bear in mind, the food may be running late because they\'ve had to send someone out to buy more supplies or the gas isn\'t working, or whatever. Their issues tend to take longer to fix than ours would, so have a heart and try not to get angry about it, and don\'t take it out on the wait staff. \n\nThere is a good selection of juices (although on menus around Kenya they say it is freshly squeezed, they are actually from a box), the Kenyan favourites tend to be Mango or Passion (pronounced \"pash-shon\") both of which are highly sweet but pleasant enough. Sodas, water, tea and coffee are also available. \n\nThe clientele seem to be a mix of travelling business men, office workers, students and boyfriend/girlfriends out on dates. It\'s safe in there, you\'ll have no problems with beggars coming in off the streets.\n\nThe cutlery and plates seem clean enough, I\'ve yet to see a dirty one. And the food comes in quite large portions, so if you\'re ordering chicken and chips, you\'ll probably have leftovers unless you like to eat a lot. Ask to take any left over food away. If you don\'t want it for yourself for later, then give it to one of the kids outside or one of the vendors selling their wares on the street (I always do this, so I\'ll ask for an extra plate so that I can put what I want to eat onto the second plate and eat from there so as not to put my germs onto whatever food I\'m giving away). \n\nDon\'t expect gluten free, vegan, low FODMAP, preservative or paleo to be catered for. They have no idea what that is. It is your responsibility to check the menu and figure out what you can have. \n\nI like coming here not only because the food is a good price, but because I feel I can relax in here especially in the private area - it\'s a great place to catch up with my friends. Everyone just minds their own business.  \nFor myself and one extra person, I\'d pay around 1,200 - 2,000 ksh, and this includes drinks, but it also depends on what we order. I\'m a vegetarian and I find I\'m easily catered for.\n\nAlthough I do caution the drinkers, if normally hot chips and burgers are your go to when you have a bad hangover, then just order water, fruit and juice if you can manage it. The burgers and chips are too greasy for your queasy tummy.\n\nNote: I have been coming to Gilanis since 2013. I come in either for lunch or dinner, and I\'ve never been sick from the food. I\'ve rated it mid-range food but note it is considered pretty good in Kenya. I wouldn\'t go near a restaurant like this back home, but it\'s great for what it is.', 3, 'Nakuru', '2025-11-10 19:52:51', 'positive', '[\"food\", \"price_value\", \"atmosphere\", \"menu_variety\"]'),

We stopped for lunch on a day trip form Eldoret.  We placed our orders and then toured the High Altitude Runners Training Facility which got us back at Kerio View right on time!  The food was delicious and very traditional, although there was enough of a western spin (European owners and mgmt.) that something will appeal to just about any taste.  As other reviewers have stated, this is not a stop when you\'re short on time.  The service was very good, but like many places in Kenya, this is too beautiful to rush through and as long as you take that attitude, it\'s all good.  Ordering, leaving and then returning was a great idea.  Afterwards, leave time to wander the beautiful grounds with fabulous plants and fun sculptures.  A great place to walk off the wonderful lunch...or just sit, relax, and take in the gorgeous views across the Kerio Valley.  \n\nWe did not spend the night in the hotel, but may schedule that for our next trip since I\'m assured, and believe, the view changes throughout the day and evening.  The midday June weather leaves the view a little hazy, but as the sun sets, and the colors change...I can\'t wait to see it.  Also, on a clear morning, I hear you can see Mt. Kenya in the distance.  Beautiful.\n\nFor the food, there were eight of us in our party and I believe we ordered six different items from the menu including some of the daily specials (a sizzling fillet steak and spiced fish fillet) and everyone was pleased.  I got the spiced fish fillet special, a pan fried Nile perch marinated with ginger, chilies and lemon juice.  For the included side dish, you had a choice of Mexican rice,  parsley potatoes or butternut chapatti.  I chose the parsley potatoes.  Wonderful!  This was all for just 600 KSH (~$5.00 US).  I even sprang for a side of the butternut chapatti, but I thought it was not as good as other chapatti I had in the region although others in our party loved it.  The highlight was dessert!  Chocolate cake, ice cream and other delicious treats were a hit since this was not an indulgence we had the opportunity for during the previous two weeks in smaller, less developed villages of Western Kenya.\n\nThe only negative...since they don\'t like people just wandering around for free (and I understand that) our driver had a difficult time convincing the gate guards that we were really going to eat.  They wanted to charge for entrance which would be refunded when you produced your receipt.  Our experienced driver stood his ground and it all worked out, but it might be nice to work out a new system.

They even had hotel transfers complete with a chauffeur hence we wouldn’t have to worry about getting around town.\n\nWe stayed at the Bay Suite on the fourth level. It has a bedroom, dining area and living room along with the usual trappings of 5 star hotels. Walking out onto the balcony, we were treated to an unmarred view of a slice of the city as well as the magnificent Lake Victoria further beyond. After a short workout at the gym followed by a one-hour classic massage at the treatment room, I was ready to take on the city!\nFood is always such an integral part of any hotel for me and the menus didn\'t dissapoint. I chatted up the barista at the coffee lounge on the ground floor as he fixed me a cup while I marveled at his latte art. We had daiquiris at Aqua Pool Bar & Grill and toasted to good health while watching the stunning sunset! For supper, we tucked into butter naan and lamb Rogan Josh- settling for Indian despite the Pan Asian, Italian and African options available. Over all great experience. \n\n', 5, 'Kisumu', '2025-11-10 20:24:38', 'positive', '[\"food\", \"drinks\", \"service\", \"price_value\", \"atmosphere\", \"location_access\", \"menu_variety\", \"portion_size\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

The bhajia was a bit bland but the accompanying sauce was a delight. At first instance, I couldn\'t see the bacon in the burger so I asked the waitress to confirm if it was really there. Turns out there were some small pieces of bacon in there but because they were minuscule, they did not deliver the flavour you would expect bacon to lend to a burger and the beef patty was lacking in flavour and it was a bit chewy.

My cousin and I ordered food and tried to order wine, only to be told by one waitress(Molly) that it was only sold by the bottle. Another waitress gave me a conflicting information (not sure if it’s her name),to say we had to spend a minimum of 5,000 KES per head before being served.\n\nThis did not make sense, especially as I saw other guests around me being served wine, beers and whiskey by the glass without such restrictions. Even a friend of mine who had been there earlier that evening confirmed she had only ordered a glass without issue. It felt like a case of profiling and discrimination, which was very upsetting.\n\nWhen I asked to speak to a manager, the waitress was extremely rude. The manager later tried to justify the “policy,” but it did not match what I observed with other guests. Having worked within the Marriott brand myself around the world , I was shocked at how far this fell below the standards of service and respect Marriott is known for.\n\nNo guest should ever feel judged or profiled when dining in a Marriott property. I hope management takes this seriously and improves both training and attitude among the staff.\n\nIn addition, I must highlight that Molly’s attitude throughout the interaction was extremely rude and unprofessional. She made us feel as though we could not afford our meals and, worse, as though we were being profiled as having inappropriate intentions simply for being women dining at the property. Such behavior is unacceptable and goes against the very principles of hospitality that Marriott upholds. Molly should be reminded that not every woman who visits a Marriott property deserves such treatment, and I strongly recommend that she undergo retraining in Marriott’s policies and service standards!!', 1, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-24 17:56:37', 'negative', '[\"food\", \"drinks\", \"service\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

Our mains arrived like artwork: seared salmon on a bed of creamy risotto for me, and a thick, juicy ribeye for my friend, grilled to absolute perfection.\n\nThe conversation flowed as smoothly as the wine — a bold red that seemed to melt away the week’s stress with every sip. Laughter echoed across the table as we shared stories, made new memories, and let the vibe of the place carry us.\n\nAnd just when we thought it couldn’t get better: dessert. A molten chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream that should be illegal, and a crème brûlée with that perfect sugar crack on top.\n\nWe stayed longer than we planned, not wanting to break the magic. It wasn’t just the food — it was the whole experience.

Compared to the other place, it was clear from texture and taste that the prawns really were freshly caught, and had not sat in a big freezer for weeks or months (which I believe was the case in the other place I reviewed).  A bottle of very good house wine was served with a price maybe only 30% more than you would pay in a supermarket.   And the food came fast, no time wasted thawing out the prawns!  My only negative comments is that it was hard to make a booking, the phone number that shows up on Google, and maybe on Trip Advisor, gives a \'not in service\' response, had to phone the main Serena Hotel reception desk and wait to be put through.   Final bill came fast and was printed clearly, with clear instructions how to pay using mobile phone payment system, and it was only 70% of the final bill at the previous place in Shanzu that I reviewed.

The front of house team are really very good, the dining room is beautiful, the wine list is excellent.  All this is however what one should expect given the prices, but one can never be sure as we are in East Africa.  The coffee and deserts are as one would expect from Cafisserie’s sister excellent.  The fish is good, as is the sushi - although quality inconsistent on the two times I was there - excellent the first and ok the second.  The problem, and where all this falls apart for me is the meat, and this is sold as a meat restaurant.    If spending ksh 16,000 on a bottle of wine as is easily achievable on that wine list one expects to pair it with a very good steak.  Sadly, twice now, in a row, as a small group,  we have been served what can only be described as rubbish.  A good steak restaurant will show the cut to the customer before cooking.  Marbling should be evident, and it should be unfrozen.  I had sadly not seen the tomahawk, sirloin or rib eye before cooking, and they arrived at the table without any fat, steamed, unseared, overcooked, unseasoned, tough and tasteless.  They were returned and replaced with apparently fresh local t-bones from a delivery that morning.  These were to be fair better, but they were not in any way special.  If they can get a good new meat supplier and the chefs can learn to prepare and cook the meat properly - look at the photo from my review of Cut - this could be a fantastic restaurant.

Kudos for that. \n\nI recommend ordering 2 pizzas at a time for a family of 4 so that you enjoy them whilst they are hot. \n\nThis is the only Restuarant that offers fresh mushrooms pizzas in the whole of Mombasa! Even the other famous Italian restaurants do not bother to go to that length of detail! You have to be a foodie to appreciate that.

The place I ate at bears no resemblance to the reviews on here.\nOn the good side I will agree that the setting is very good and the service provided by Phillip (the waiter) was excellent.\nThe down side was the quality of the meal and the price we were charged for it.\nMy partner ordered French Onion Soup which we had to return as it had more salt in than Onions - it was changed and the replacement one was slightly better. What is it with kenyan Chefs and salt - do they realise that if they put too little salt in you can add more - once they have put too much the dish becomes inedible as you can\'t take it out. \nMy starter a crab \'Timbale\' was average and not worth the 1000ksh cost (with Taxes).\nWe ordered Seafood Platter each as a main course and at over 4000ksh each (with Taxes) was basically extortionate vis a vis the quality.\nThe Lobster was miniscule and overcooked - the Crabs Claws were overcooked - the Kingfish Steak was overcooked, dried up and very small. The King Prawns were fine.\nI have eaten Seafood Platter at many Restaurants on the coast and this was by fat the worst in terms of value and quality. Maybe the Food and Beverage Manager should look at Tamarind or Monsoons - their quality and value put Whitesands to shame.\nThe desserts were not a lot better - over 1000ksh (with Taxes) for something very average.\nAnybody who complains about Tamarind prices should go here - they would never complain again.\nI feel that alot of the previous reviews were written by guests at the hotel who had not eaten at outside Restaurants and had something to compare with.\nOverall the quality of the meal was very poor and was exceptionally poor value for money and t was the sort I would expect from a small local Cafe a fifth of the price.', 2, 'Mombasa', '2025-11-24 18:35:47', 'negative', '[\"food\", \"service\", \"price_value\", \"location_access\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

I asked if it was possible to not put the wheat salad on the plate explaining my case, and I was told that it was not possible (this is just one example of several). So either I have to pick in the side list (a side of poach eggs with a side of plain spinach..again, not very tasty and pretty bland), or one of the very few wheat free dishes available, even though it would not be too hard for them to not put an ingredient on a plate to make it gluten free and it would make the menu much more appealing.\nOn the Sunday morning brunch, I can have a single dish (two actually if I count the coconut milk fruit salad).

Our waffle took much longer, but was delicious, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, sliced strawberries, some whipped cream, and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.

I thought I could literary taste it on my tongue. We look around the, it\'s was almost 89% full. Believe us when we say, its a very small space - roughly it can fit comfortably about 20- 25 people from the original set up. I would say, this cafe would be great for a date, morning official meetings, discussion group, family time and parties.\nOver the counter, the list on the menu is right above the counter - with about 4 gentlemen each having a different task - I believe, and 1 lady by the far right of the counter, seriously and busy grinding the coffee beans into this huge coffee machine that is done in open space. We spotted empty seats at the right overlooking the parking lot, since the glass barrier is super clear with connect coffee stickers on it in a stripe formula, with raised bar stools - then settled there.\n\nThis being our first time there, these are the things to consider if you are a newbie:\n\n#1. Its\' a self service Environment.\n\nYou walk in, look around, spot a seat {Pray that no one takes it}, walk over the counter, place your order - pay, then back to your table and wait for food/drink.\n.\n#2. Professionalism & friendly staff\nIts\' such a breath of fresh air to receive the simplest gestures like a greeting from the staff and made to feel comfortable. That\'s what we were received with.\n.\n#3. You\'ve got to try out their WAFFLES!!! OMG - Amazing!!\nApart from the coffee, get yourself waffles. You definitely deserve it, because it\'s done so well, the plating, presentation and deliciousness is beyond words. AMAZING!!\n.\n#4. Is it worth the Money & Fuss? \nYES!! YES!! YES!! \nIts\' not expensive neither is it cheap. The waffles and Coffee is of pure quality. I totally recommend them. We actually had - waffles and Mocha Milkshake. Yum!!\n.\n#5. Why WIFI - why??\nYes, they have WIFI connectivity, and yes its absolutely free. The problem is, give or take every 8 to 12 mins of the first input of the password, it disables again and you have to input the password again. Who has that time?? It\'s annoying - FYI- when using a cell phone, not sure if using your laptop.\n.\n#6. Be watchful when buying bottled water.\nNot sure if this was just this particular bottle of water, but even before we removed the wrap and opened the bottle, we could see \"floating fishes\". White particles in the water. Disturbing as it may have seemed then, we alerted the waiters and they immediately took action and replace us with another clean bottled water. I\'m not brushing it completely, but be watchful!!\n.\n#7. Decor is Classy.\nPersonally, I am a super fan of classy decor, and they\'ve got it. Fresh but classy especially the design and lighting.\n.\nMy rate - 8/10\nI look forward to sample it\'s other list on the menu and enjoy that space with more friends and family.\n\n', 4, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-24 19:35:40', 'positive', '[\"food\", \"drinks\", \"service\", \"price_value\", \"atmosphere\", \"location_access\", \"menu_variety\", \"portion_size\", \"events_entertainment\", \"overall_experience\"]'),

The fish however was not Red Snapper , it had an unpleasant taste and smell . Characteristic of Nile Perch. The waiter had a total lack of attention we had to refill our own drinks.

When we confronted the waiter about the fish he just smile , when we asked him why we had to pour our own drinks and why he served warm Prosecco his reply was “ it’s cold now “. My partner did not touch her fish. The owner of the restaurant then appeared at our table and was quite confrontational. She advised us she took offense to what we said about her fish. We suggested she try it but to no avail. On pointing out that we had to pour our own drinks and that her staff are serving warm drinks her reply “ what’s to difference hot or cold Prosecco “. \nWe prompt asked for the bill and left two glasses of Prosecco on the table. \nThis has truly been my worst experience in a restaurant in Nairobi. \nA neighboring table of Chinese guests also did not eat the fish.

This is what happened to the dynamic co-owner of La Terrazza, a shining star in the panorama of Italian restaurants around the world, Ms. Murielle, a Frenchwoman who is bursting with energy like a new star of the galaxy. An indefinable vital force that leads it to be the precious engine of this restaurant, and that gives it that \"sixth sense\" that women entrepreneurs are more gifted with than us men. Murielle makes use of many smart people, the nice Stefano, sommelier and administrative mind of the place, and the various collaborators that are worth mentioning: Makau, Said, Tunge, Didi, Gedion and the kitchen team: Thomas, Rafael and Stephan. Let\'s talk about the place: young but classic and colored by the paintings of the excellent Tomasi, all between elegance, style and class, with adequate and non-invasive background music. Let\'s talk about the menu: I chose an antipasto based on Cipriani carpaccio, followed by an excellent dish of ricotta and spinach ravioli, and a very fillet (the meat is really delicious), with a tiramisu as a worthy finish. And I must also say about the wine list because I have seen and studied it, I drank some excellent wine from the Lagrein Winery. Next time I will go to the bottom of the other wineries! The desserts are splendid, and - let me tell you - the bread basket assortment is incredibly good. The bread that Murielle makes is worth the trip alone! Impeccably cared for service, the bill absolutely justified by the quality, and in fact I will be back, indeed I thanked those who recommended La Terrazza to me, because I was really good and this place deserves the influx of Italians and real gourmets who are in Nairobi .\nIn conclusion: a very pleasant restaurant, one of those that deservedly end up on the front page of specialized newspapers, but above all, in our hearts, it goes and will remain.', 5, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-24 19:50:47', 'positive', '[\"service\", \"price_value\", \"location_access\"]'),

As we were leaving the owner simply stared at us, unsmilingly and not bothered if we enjoyed our meal.

We were soon presented with a lovely plate of brownie and other small delights with a firework candle each - a lovely touch. \nBottom line - the decor doesn’t match the quality of service and food. It’s definitely an excellent restaurant and it’s worth paying the higher price for the quality of food.

We were there for lunch.  Perhaps it is a much nicer venue in the evenings.  The restaurant is located in an old farmhouse in a residential area.  During the day, everything looks very scruffy.  I suppose that is the look that is intended, but if you want to have a \"shabby chic\" place, the tablecloths, cutlery, plates and glasses must be immaculate and very attractive.  None of this.  Some tables had no tablecloths and those that did, did not even seem very clean.  Everything, or almost everything, happens outside (obviously try not to go there when it rains - though they do have some tables indoors).\nThe wines are very expensive.  Actually quite outrageously expensive, because they offer bottles that are available in wine shops in Nairobi and the prices are almost quadrupled.\nWe had the bisque.  It was ok, but really did not have much taste.\nThe steak was great and very tasty.  However the rice that accompanied it was tasteless.  I had the risotto with fish and prawns.  The fish was ok.  The risotto was absolutely terrible.  Actually it was the same as the rise accompanying the steak, so it was tasteless and full of mushrooms which really have nothing to do with the fish.  Perhaps a chef\'s speciality, but the mushrooms were not nice and I usually love them.\nWe had wine by the glass and our bill, for three people was over ksh20,000 which I believe is very high for the quality of food that we were served.  I am sorry, but I do not think we shall be returning soon.', 3, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-25 08:31:59', '', ''),

They were offering a four course dinner - with or without a wine pairing. You need to know upfront that this is not a budget friendly place. Come with a full wallet and an empty belly. That said, the food is incredibly fresh and well prepared. I really appreciated that there were at least two vegetarian options for every course. The meal started with complimentary bruschetta and  champagne. I had a really nice beet salad with a yogurt dressing - a flavor pairing I\'d never tried before. The artichoke and asparagus fritter was also quite nice. I was a little underwhelmed by the wild mushroom risotto which could have used a little more seasoning. The shared dessert plate was a nice end to the meal. The service was very good and attentive. And the venue is cozy, as if you were sitting on the patio of someone\'s farm house (which is precisely what it is). The owner/chef is affable and told us a bit about the history of the place. Definitely a gem in Nairobi but one that we\'ll likely reserve for special occasions given the price.', 4, 'Nairobi', '2025-11-25 08:31:59', '', ''),
